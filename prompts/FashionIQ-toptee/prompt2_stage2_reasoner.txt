Task Description:
The task of Atomic Proposition Generation involves breaking down a instruction into multiple simple, verifiable propositions, each having a unique answer that is either True (Yes) or False (No). Based on the provided instruction and a target image description, you need to break down the instruction into several atomic propositions and coresponding answers, following the three steps below.
1. Step 1 is to convert each atmoic instruction into statement sentence. If the atomic instruction is comparison, write the instruction into comparison between left and write image.
2. Step 2 is to convert each statement sentence into interrogative sentence, also provide the ground truth answer based on the instruction.
The instruction and atomic instructions will be given to you to solve the task.
