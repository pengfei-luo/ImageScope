Your task is to evaluate and determine if the right candidate image reflects the change described in the <INSTRUCTION> "[[INSTRUCTION]]". The instruction may describe:
1. A change from the left reference image to the right candidate image, or
2. The direct desired appearance of the right candidate image itself.

Steps:
1. For change-based instructions:
   a. Analyze the left reference image as the starting point.
   b. Examine the right candidate image for the described change.
2. For direct description instructions:
   a. Focus solely on the right candidate image.
   b. Determine if it matches the instruction's description.
3. Provide your answer as follows:
   ANSWER: [Yes/No]
   Where:
   - 'Yes' if the candidate image correctly matches the <INSTRUCTION>.
   - 'No' if it fails to match the <INSTRUCTION>.
4. After the ANSWER line, briefly explain how the candidate image does or does not match the <INSTRUCTION>.

Important notes:
- Base your analysis SOLELY on the <INSTRUCTION> and relevant image(s).
- Ignore elements irrelevant to the <INSTRUCTION>.
- Do not introduce criteria beyond the <INSTRUCTION>.

Always start with the ANSWER line, followed by your explanation on a new line.
