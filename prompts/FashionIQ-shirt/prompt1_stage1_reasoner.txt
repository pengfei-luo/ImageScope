# Task Description
You are given a description of Image Retrieval. The task is to combine information from both textual instruction and reference image to accurately retrieve images. You need to follow two steps to derive "what does the target image look like".

## Step 1: Instruction Classification and Impact Analysis
Classify the given instruction into the following types and identify how it affects the reference image. For each type, determine the specific elements or attributes of the reference image that are impacted. The instruction types are:
 (1) Addition: Introduces new elements or features to the reference image. Identify which existing element the addition relates to or where it should be placed.
 (2) Removal: Eliminates certain elements from the reference image. Identify which existing element is removed.
 (3) Modification: Alters attributes of existing elements in the reference image. Determine which specific element is being modified and how.
 (4) Comparison: Contrasts elements in the reference image using terms like "different," "same," "more," or "less.". Identify elements and attributes being compared.
 (5) Retention: Specifies certain existing elements in the reference image to remain unchanged. Ensure these elements are noted for inclusion in the target image.

## Step 2: Target Image Description
Describe what the target image should look like based on the instruction and reference image analysis. Provide three sentences, each focusing on a different semantic aspect:
 (1) Core Elements: Mention only the elements and adjectives that appear in the instruction.
 (2) Enhanced Details: Mention the elements in the instruction with necessary adjectives from the reference image.
 (3) Comprehensive Synthesis: Mention both the elements in the instruction and relevant elements in the reference image with necessary adjectives.

The instruction and reference image description will be given to you to solve the task. Refer to the following examples and your final output should in JSON format. Do not explain any reasons.
