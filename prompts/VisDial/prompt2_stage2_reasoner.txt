# Task Description
The task of Atomic Proposition Generation involves breaking down a instruction into multiple simple, verifiable propositions, each having a unique answer that is either True (Yes) or False (No). Based on the provided instruction and a target image description, you need to break down the instruction into several atomic propositions and coresponding answers, following the two steps below.

## Step 1: Statement Sentence Conversion
Convert each atmoic instruction into statement sentence. There are five types of atmoic instruction: addition, removal, modification, comparison and keep.

## Step 2: Question Form Conversion
Convert each statement sentence into questions, also provide the ground truth answer based on the given instruction.

The instruction and atomic instructions will be given to you to solve the task.

Here is an example:

### Query
 - Instruction: has the person holding a baby
 - Atomic Instructions:
   (1) Addition: Make the woman holding a baby.

### Solve
1. **Step 1.** Based on the atomic instructions, the statements are:
 (1) There is a woman holding a baby.

2. **Step 2.** Based on step 1, the questions and answers are:
 (1) Q: Is there a woman holding a baby? A: Yes. (True)

```json
{
  "step1": [
    "There is a woman holding a baby."
  ],
  "step2": [
    ["Is there a woman holding a baby?", "True"]
  ],
}
```

Here is an example:

### Query
 - Instruction: is zoomed in and shows a potted plant on it
 - Atomic Instructions:
   (1) Addition: Make a potted plant placed on the white refrigerator.
   (2) Comparison: With a zoomed in view.
   
### Solve
1. **Step 1.** Based on the atomic instructions, the statements are:
 (1) A potted plant is placed on a white refrigerator.
 (2) The image is a zoomed in view.
     
2. **Step 2.** Based on step 1, the questions and answers are:
   (1) Q: Is there a potted plant placed on a white refrigerator? A: Yes. (True)
   (2) Q: Is the image on the right a zoomed in view? A: Yes. (True)

```json
{
  "step1": [
    "A potted plant is placed on a white refrigerator.",
    "The image is a zoomed in view."
  ],
  "step2": [
    ["Is there a potted plant placed on a white refrigerator?", "True"],
    ["Is the image on the right a zoomed in view", "True"]
  ]
}

 (2) Q: Is there a fridge? A: Yes. (True)
 (3) Q: Is there an oven? A: No. (False)
  
```json
{ 
  "step1": [
    "There are two dogs.",
    "There is a fridge.",
    "There is not an oven."
  ],
  "step2": [
    ["Are there two dogs?", "True"],
    ["Is there a fridge?", "True"],
    ["Is there an over?", "False"]
  ]
}
